# History
1597 started development in 2021 (when i was 9) as Inlect's 1597. The project was quickly scraped though, due to me not knowing how to code. In late 2022, i decided to make MLauncher 0.1, after i found a piece of example code explaining how to make a password script in python. Years Later, i (13 now), made 1597 3.0 with tons of improvements to older versions. i will continue to update and patch any bugs found in my software. THX for reading
